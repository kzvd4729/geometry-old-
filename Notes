1. Sine Rule: a/sinA=b/sinB=c/sinC (a is the oponent side of angle A).
2. Cosine Rule: a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc cosA.
3. Angle of regular polygoan = (n-2)pi/n;
4. Apothem of polygoan(shortest distance from center to side) = side/2tan(pi/n);
5. In a N*N grid a convexhull can have maximum N^(2/3) vertices of lattice point
   after omitting straight line point. For random input it is N(1/3);
